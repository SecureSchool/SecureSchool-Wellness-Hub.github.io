            <h2>Step 2:Understand Aftershocks</h2>
            <p>Learn about what aftershocks are and how they occur. Aftershocks are smaller earthquakes that follow the main earthquake and can occur minutes, hours, days, or even weeks afterward.</p>
            <p>While aftershocks are usually weaker than the main quake, they can still cause additional damage and pose a risk to safety.</p>
