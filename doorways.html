                <p>Instead of standing in a doorway during an earthquake, practice the "Drop, Cover, and Hold On" technique. Drop to the ground, take cover under a sturdy piece of furniture, and hold on until the shaking stops.</p>

            <h2>Step 2:Move Away from Doors</h2>
            <p>If you are near a doorway when an earthquake begins, move away from the door and seek shelter under a sturdy piece of furniture or against an interior wall.</p>
            <p>Avoid standing in doorways as they do not provide adequate protection from falling objects or collapsing structures.</p>

                <p>Identify safe locations in your home, school, or workplace where you can take shelter during earthquakes.</p>

            <div class="step-description">
                <p>In most cases, it is safer to stay indoors during earthquakes rather than attempting to exit the building. Moving during the shaking increases the risk of injury from falling debris or collapsing structures.</p>
                <p> Stay inside until the shaking stops and it is safe to evacuate.</p>
